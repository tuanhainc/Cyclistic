# Background
## About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the company wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Cyclistic will use these insights for a marketing program development aiming to transform casual into annual riders.
